## Objectives

This is analyzing the Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) of Titanium-64 alloy. Here we look at the different samples printed and compared with their respective parameter settings. It's about studying 3D defects in materials, using X-ray synchrotron machine learning at the Department of Aerospace Engineering.

## Power vs Scanspeed

The graph below shows the comparison of the power of the laser while printing the sample and against the scan speed of the laser. After all data samples are processed we need to see which printing   parameters suit for our alloy. In order to study that we need to plot all the data we have on an excel/scv file in in the data folder using python or java.
Then we can compare and see how each sample's parameters are best suited for our project going forward.

## Porosity vs Parameter

This one on the other hand compares the porosity formation in each sample. We can see that the porosity percentage changes according to the power and laser scan speed. The higher the power the lower the scan speed provides a deeper melt pool, and creates a lot of keyholes. Likewise the lower the power and the higher the scan speed leads to lack of fusion pores. Indicating that our best shot to getting the better sample is in the mid upper triangle as seen in the graph with lower porosity percentage. Red is what we're trying avoid, and blue is the one we're aiming at.
