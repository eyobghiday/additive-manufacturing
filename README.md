# Material Caracterization
This is a project I'm currently working. It's a Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) of Titanium-64 alloy. It is about studying 3D defects in materials, using X-ray synchrotron machine learning at the Department of Aerospace Engineering.
Particle technology as sub-discipline of process engineering summarizes the broad range of processes, where particles are syn- thesized, tailored, separated or are used as supporting agent. The characterization of these processes and of the particles thus is key for a detailed understanding. As particles are three- dimensional objects, their morphology as well as the macroscopic structures formed by the particles should be characterized using three-dimensional methods. Using methods of lower dimension often is bound to a loss of information such as a particle size distri- bution based on a single equivalent diameter, a pore size distribu- tion of a specimen without having the spatial information of the pore network or the stereological bias known in the field of con- ventional microscopy.

# Technologies Used
1. Microscopy 
2. Spectroscopy 
3. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM)
4. XRD (X-ray Diffraction)
5. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS)
6. Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) is a well-established scanning electron microscope (SEM) based technique used for material characterization. Microstructural organization (crystallographic information) of the material is assessed by analyzing diffraction patterns to determine the crystal orientation, characterize grain boundaries, provide information about the local crystalline status, as well as identify and distinguish phases when combined with EDS measurement.
